## Project Status Update - Checkpoint

### Changes Made Since Last Checkpoint:

-   **TailwindCSS/PostCSS/Vite Build Issue Resolution:**
    -   Removed `postcss.config.js` file.
    -   Reordered `@import` statements in `styles/main.css` to place `@import "./polish.css";` before `@tailwind` directives, resolving the build error.
    -   The project now builds successfully.

-   **UI Polish (SettingsModal.tsx - Partial):**
    -   Updated the authentication section's button and input field styling to use `primary` color.
    -   Updated the toggle switch colors in the "General Settings Card" to use `primary` and `accent` colors.
    -   Updated the "Add Provider" button to use `primary` color.
    -   Updated the day selection buttons for providers to use `primary` color for selected days.
    -   Updated the extra capacity tags to use `accent` color.

### What was removed:

-   `postcss.config.js` file.
-   The `css` block from `vite.config.ts` (this was a temporary change during debugging and has been reverted by removing `postcss.config.js`).
-   The `jsxBracketSameLine` property from `.prettierrc.json` (due to deprecation warning).

### What Remains to be Done:

-   **Complete UI Polish:** Continue polishing other components (e.g., `DayView`, `WeekView`, `MonthView`, `SettingsModal` (remaining parts), `HomeExercisesModal` itself, common components) using the new color palette and ensuring responsiveness.
-   **Netlify Deployment Configuration Verification:** The `netlify.toml` was created, but needs to be verified once the build issue is resolved.
-   **Review code for production best practices:** (e.g., environment variables, performance optimizations, accessibility).
